BELOW IS THE STRAIGHT FORWARD SOLUTION
##########################################################################################################
The error message you're encountering indicates that VLC Media Player is unable to play the MIDI file due to the absence of a sound font file (.SF2). A sound font file is necessary for MIDI synthesis, as it contains the audio samples needed to render the MIDI data as sound.

Here are the steps to set up MIDI playback in VLC using a sound font file:

### Step 1: Download a Sound Font File
You need to download a sound font file. One commonly used sound font is "FluidR3 GM.sf2". You can download it from various sources online. Here is a link to download it:

[FluidR3 GM SoundFont](https://schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php)

### Step 2: Configure VLC to Use the Sound Font
1. **Open VLC Preferences**:
   - Open VLC Media Player.
   - Go to `Tools` > `Preferences` or press `Ctrl+P`.

2. **Show All Settings**:
   - At the bottom left corner of the Preferences window, select `All` under `Show settings`.

3. **Navigate to FluidSynth**:
   - In the left sidebar, navigate to `Input / Codecs` > `Audio codecs` > `FluidSynth`.

4. **Set the Sound Font File**:
   - In the FluidSynth settings, there is an option called `SoundFont`. Click `Browse` and select the `.SF2` file you downloaded earlier (e.g., `FluidR3_GM.sf2`).

5. **Save and Restart VLC**:
   - Save the changes and restart VLC Media Player.

### Step 3: Play the MIDI File
After setting up the sound font, try playing the MIDI file again in VLC. It should now be able to synthesize and play the MIDI file correctly.

### Additional Option: Using a Different MIDI Player
If VLC continues to have issues, you can use another MIDI player that has built-in support for sound fonts, such as:

- **Windows Media Player** (on Windows): Often has built-in support for MIDI files.
- **Timidity++**: A software synthesizer that can play MIDI files using sound fonts.
- **MuseScore**: A music notation software that can play MIDI files and offers extensive sound font support.

### Summary of Steps
1. Download a sound font file (e.g., `FluidR3_GM.sf2`).
2. Configure VLC to use the sound font file via preferences.
3. Play the MIDI file in VLC or use an alternative MIDI player.

By following these steps, you should be able to hear the generated MIDI file.
